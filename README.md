# SPACEX-first-stage-success-analysis
This project will try to predict if a Falcon 9 first stage launch will land successfully.


SpaceX lists Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website at a cost of $62 million, while other providers charge over $165 million per launch. A large part of these savings comes from SpaceXâ€™s ability to reuse the first stage of the rocket. Therefore, knowing whether the first stage will successfully land allows us to estimate the launch cost. This information could be valuable for competing companies looking to bid against SpaceX for rocket launches.
